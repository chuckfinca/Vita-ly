            <p>Vita-ly connects you with the experts that show you how to lose weight and get fit. With diets, exercise, massage and other programs matched to your unique needs, goals and health profile.</p>
            <span class="title">Tell us what you need or let us guide you</span>
            <p>You can choose by type of service, such as “massage therapy” and by specialty, such as “active release technique.”</p>
            <p>Or tell us what you need and we’ll help guide you.  Just type what you’re looking for in the search bar, such as “show me fitness professionals that have expertise with knee injuries in Palo Alto.”</p>
            <span class="title">A perfect match</span>
            <p>Either way, Vita-ly will take it from there, matching you with certified fitness and wellness professionals in your area.  Browse the profiles to learn about approach and specialties, and to check references and recommendations.  Then one button connects you to schedule a conversation or appointment, and to start your journey toward better health.</p>
            <span class="title">Specific is better than generic</span>
            <p>The fitness and wellness professionals you’ll find in Vita-ly start with an assessment… someone that actually listens to you.  Because programs and approaches based on your unique challenges and specific goals will beat a YouTube video, fitness app or chain weight loss center every time.</p>
            <p>This is true generally.  It’s especially true for Baby Boomers and others dealing with accumulated injuries or years of inactivity, or the many other challenges that come with advancing age or illness.</p>
            <span class="title">Wherever you like</span>
            <p>In your home.  At a studio.  In a group. At the park or at the beach.</p>
            <span class="title">It’s free.</span>
            <p>There is no cost to search for health and fitness professionals. No registration is required and you don’t have to share any personal information.</p>
